/*
 * Given an array nums of n integers, return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.
Examples:

Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Output: 4

Explanation: The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]

Output: 9

Explanation: The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has a length of 9.

Input: nums = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]
Output:
4
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
